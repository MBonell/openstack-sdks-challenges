# My Pet's Photo Album: Sample App
The application uses Swift API to upload pictures in an OpenStack cloud. The web photo album displays those images from the cloud. The code sample uses [Shade](http://docs.openstack.org/infra/shade/) (Python) as SDK.

## App flow

    username: admin
    password: admin
    project_name: default
    domain_id: default
  region_name: RegionOne
